PREREQUISITES FOR INSTALLATION
==============================

NOTE: CoinDir is the path to the directory of COIN
NOTE: AlpsDir is the path to the directory of COIN/Alps

1. Download the necessary components (Alps, Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl) of COIN
   - Alps depends on Coin.
   - Example CoinDir/Examples/Knap depends on Coin
   - Example CoinDir/Examples/Abc depends on Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl
   - AlpsDir/Bcps (to be released) depends on Coin
   - AlpsDir/Bcps/Blis (to be released) depends on Coin, Clp, Osi, Cgl
2. At the moment, on (*)nix platforms, you must use g++ 2.95.2 or higher.
3. must use gnu make
4. To make the documentation, doxygen must be installed


TO CREATE HTML DOCUMENTATION
============================

In AlpsDir, 'make doc' to create the html documentation of the classes 
in the library. By default, the created html documentation is in
AlpsDir/Doc/html.


TO BUILD ALPS SERIAL LIBRARY AND RUN EXAMPLES
=============================================

1. Read and edit the top of AlpsDir/Makefile.config:
   - select to build serial library by 
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = NONE' if it is commented
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = MPICH' if it is not
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = LAMMPI' if it is not
   - select whether to build shared or static library
   - select optimization level

2. In AlpsDir, 'make' to build and install the Alps serial library.

3. Build and run examples. Please refer to the INSTALL files in 
   CoinDir/Examples/Knap or CoinDir/Examples/Abc.


TO BUILD ALPS PARALLEL LIBRARY AND RUN EXAMPLES
===============================================

1. Read and edit the top of Makefile.config:
   - select to build parallel library by 
     - commenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = NONE' if it is not
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = MPICH' if using MPICH
     - uncommenting line 'export MESSAGE_INTERFACE = LAMMPI' if using LAMMPI
   - select optimization level

2. In AlpsDir, 'make' to build and install the Alps parallel library.

3. Build and run examples. Please refer to the INSTALL files in 
   CoinDir/Examples/Knap or CoinDir/Examples/Abc.
